### 1. What part of the UI did you develop or design?
I wasn’t directly assigned to the UI, but I contributed by giving design suggestions and feedback on layout choices to improve usability and consistency across pages.

### 2. What challenges did you encounter using Git for collaboration?
Managing different branches and keeping our versions in sync was sometimes confusing, especially when merging changes from multiple members. We also had to deal with a few merge conflicts during updates.

### 3. How does your part contribute to the overall user experience?
My input helped ensure that the interface remained intuitive and cohesive. By suggesting layout and flow improvements, I contributed to making the app easier to navigate and visually consistent.

### 4. What improvements can be made to the interface or user flow?
The checkout process and product browsing experience could be improved for smoother transitions. Adding clearer confirmation prompts and optimizing responsiveness for smaller screens would enhance usability further.
