## Member: De Vera (kevs-04)

### 1. What part of the UI did you develop or design?
I worked on the Navbar and HomePage of our E-Commerce website. The Navbar allows users to navigate easily between pages, while the HomePage serves as the main entry point for users to explore our products.

### 2. What challenges did you encounter using Git for collaboration?
One challenge I faced was managing multiple branches and avoiding merge conflicts. At first, I got confused about when to push, pull, or merge, but I learned how to properly create branches and make pull requests.

### 3. How does your part contribute to the overall user experience?
My components improve navigation and first impressions. The Navbar provides smooth access to pages, and the HomePage creates a welcoming and organized layout for users.

### 4. What improvements can be made to the interface or user flow?
I think adding more responsive design and animation effects could make the interface more interactive and visually appealing.

### 1. What part of the UI did you develop or design?
I wasn’t directly assigned to the UI, but I contributed by giving design suggestions and feedback on layout choices to improve usability and consistency across pages.

### 2. What challenges did you encounter using Git for collaboration?
Managing different branches and keeping our versions in sync was sometimes confusing, especially when merging changes from multiple members. We also had to deal with a few merge conflicts during updates.

### 3. How does your part contribute to the overall user experience?
My input helped ensure that the interface remained intuitive and cohesive. By suggesting layout and flow improvements, I contributed to making the app easier to navigate and visually consistent.

### 4. What improvements can be made to the interface or user flow?
The checkout process and product browsing experience could be improved for smoother transitions. Adding clearer confirmation prompts and optimizing responsiveness for smaller screens would enhance usability further.
